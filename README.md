# Sorting Visualizer

Angular-powered web app that visually demonstrates various sorting algorithms using bars of varying heights. The app is built using Angular and allows users to choose from several sorting algorithms, including bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort. As the sorting algorithm runs, the app updates the color and height of the bars to reflect the current state of the sorting process.
